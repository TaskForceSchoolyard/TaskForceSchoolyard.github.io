                <p> The purpose of this organization is for the sake of being in a club, and also playing pranks on other people.  There are ranks, code names, and all that Jazz.  We will keep moving our meeting point for the sake of keeping the would-be assassins guessing.  First off is our ranks, starting from highest to lowest.</p>
            </div>
           <h2>Ranks</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Supreme Captain (This rank is only available to founders), Votes: 7</li>
                <li>Captain, Votes: 6</li>
                <li>Lieutenant, Votes: 5</li>
                <li>Sargeant, Votes: 4</li>
                <li>Corporal, Votes: 3</li>
                <li>Private, Votes: 2</li>
                <li>Peasant, Votes: 1</li>
            </ol>
            <div class= "long-text">    
                <p>Every new recruit starts at Peasant, and works his or her way to Captain at the most.  The higher the rank, the more votes he or she has on an occasion.  The next order of business is our member's profiles.  Profiles are highly classified information, so no images will be added.</p>

                <h2></h2>
                <p>After profiles, the next order of business is our oath.  Our oath is to be said by every recruit.  It states that he or she will not quit or join another organization opposing ours.  Each oath will be recorded.</p>_
                <h2>Oath</h2>
                <p>I, [Recruit's Name], solemnly swear never to quit this club.  I will conduct all ranks in a polite manner, and I will never join an opposing organization.  I will not tell of this organization or its members until further notice.</p>
                <h2></h2>
                <p>After a recruit says the oath, they have to know the rules.  Rules are not strict, but a violation of them can result in demoting or the banning of the violator.</p>
                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>All opposed decisions will be voted on.</li>
                    <li>Banning a member will be voted on by the founders.</li>
                    <li>Any violence toward each other will result is immediate demotion or possible ban.</li>
                    <li>No disrespecting any other members.</li>
                    <li>All members have a right to oppose a decision, creating a voting occasion.</li>
                    <li>Leaders of core groups are the only ones that may select and propose to recruit more members to that section.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Next is code words.  Code words can be used to call a meeting or to address an enemy.(Also, snacks in meetings are encouraged!)</p>
                <h2>Code Words</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>RAR (Rock At Recess)</li>
                    <li>DAR (Dump At Recess)</li>
                    <li>WHAL (We Have A Listener)</li>
                    <li>SE (Somewhere Else)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finally, there is reports.  Reports are given often, so this section will be updated a lot.</p>
                <h2>Reports</h2>
                <p>10-25-16_______Report given by Joseph Uyemura<br>On this day, Josue Martinez was promoted from Private due to completion of Training Mission A#01.</p>
                
                <h2></h2>
                <p>10-27-16_______Report Given by Joseph Uyemura<br>Today Camden Riggleman was promoted to Private and assigned an intel gathering mission.  He completed Training Mission A#01 to do so.  He will commence the mission on Tuesday, September 1.</p>
                
                <h2></h2>
                <p>11-15-16_______Report Given by Benjamin Rebis<br>A meeting was held, the attenders being Joseph Uyemura, Brenden Jones, Josue Martinez, Benjamin Rebis, and Brady Collins.  Not much was accomplished in the meeting, except for updates on the website.  Also, a suspected rival organization was deemed a false alarm when a small task proved that the suspects were free of any suspicious happenence.</p>
                
                <h2></h2>
                <p>11-21-16_______Report given by Joseph Uyemura<br>The website has been updated, changing and giving new specializations.</p>
                
                <h2></h2>
                <p>11-28-16_______Report given by Benjamin Rebis<br>The website has been updated, giving Strategist Josue Martinez a promotion to Sargeant for vital information, acrobatic demonstration, and stelth demonstration.  Also, "Core Group" and "Badges" categories were put into members' profiles.</p>
                
                <h2></h2>
                <p>12-01-16_______Report given by Benjamin Rebis<br>The site has been updated, promoting Diversion Specialist Camden Riggleman to Sargeant for completing intel mission A#01.  He recovered the info that the 5th graders don't like 6th graders playing basketball(an annoyance possibility) and the football games get heated.(Another annoyance possibility.)  The last bit of imfo he gathered was that on the Northeast Tree on the playground, a group of students works o homework and call random numbers.(Possibly a threat opportunity.) A meeting was held, in which the attenders were Joseph Uyemura, Benjamin Rebis, Camden Riggleman, and Brenden Jones.</p>
