            <div class="long-text">
                <p> The purpose of this organization is for the sake of being in a club, and also playing pranks on other people.  There are ranks, code names, and all that Jazz.  We will keep moving our meeting point for the sake of keeping the would-be assassins guessing.  First off is our ranks, starting from highest to lowest.</p>
            </div>
           <h2>Ranks</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Supreme Captain (This rank is only available to founders), Votes: 7</li>
                <li>Captain, Votes: 6</li>
                <li>Lieutenant, Votes: 5</li>
                <li>Sargeant, Votes: 4</li>

            <div class= "long-text">    
                <p>Every new recruit starts at Peasant, and works his or her way to Captain at the most.  The higher the rank, the more votes he or she has on an occasion.  The next order of business is our member's profiles.  Profiles are highly classified information, so no images will be added.</p>

                <p>After profiles, the next order of business is our oath.  Our oath is to be said by every recruit.  It states that he or she will not quit or join another organization opposing ours.  Each oath will be recorded.</p>_

                <h2></h2>
                <p>After a recruit says the oath, they have to know the rules.  Rules are not strict, but a violation of them can result in demoting or the banning of the violator.</p>

                    <li>All opposed decisions will be voted on.</li>

                    <li>No disrespecting any other members.</li>
                    <li>All members have a right to oppose a decision, creating a voting occasion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Next is code words.  Code words can be used to call a meeting or to address an enemy.(Also, snacks in meetings are encouraged!)</p>
