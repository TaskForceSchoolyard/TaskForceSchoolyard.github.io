                <p> The purpose of this organization is for the sake of being in a club, and also playing pranks on other people.  There are ranks, code names, and all that Jazz.  We will keep moving our meeting point for the sake of keeping the would-be assassins guessing.  First off is our ranks, starting from highest to lowest.</p>
